## Form Handling Approach
This is a **React.js App** where I tried some strictly front-end form validation methods

## Main functionalities
The app uses different input fields and where possible uses inbuilt HTML5 validations or a pattern atribute
Except the date input where validation is actually restriction to what values can be input.

#
In the project directory, you can run
### `npm start`
This runs the app in the development mode on http://localhost:3000/
